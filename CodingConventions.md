## 3. Project Structure
- Structure:
  - Frontend: 
    - Must have its own repository
    - We will use a modular architecture. 
    - Main function: Display formatted views and capture user data
  - Backend: 
    - Must have its own repository
    - We will use a modular architecture.
    - Function: Manage communication, process data, and validate users.
- Mandatory files (README, .env.example, etc.)

## 4. Naming Conventions
### 4.1 Files and folders
- Style:
    - File names: PascalCase
    - Variable names: camelCase
    - Function names: camelCase
    - Constant names: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
    - Routes: kebab-case
    - Folders: snake_case
    - Tables and DB Names: snake_case
- Allowed prefixes/suffixes:
    - FrontEnd:    
        - Composables: use -> useAuth.ts
        - Views: Page -> LoginPage.vue
        - Interfaces: .interfaces. -> users.interfaces.ts 
    - BackEnd:
        - Controllers: Controller -> AuthController.php

### 4.2 Variables
- Language: English
- Semantics: descriptive names (avoid x, y) except for iterators.
- Booleans: Must have a prefix (is, has, can..)
### 4.3 Functions and methods
- Verb + action. Example (getVehicleLocation(), storeCoordinate(), calculateDistance())
- Recommended maximum length: 20-30 lines

### 4.4 Classes and components
- Name pattern: PascalCase
- Singular

### 4.5 Constants
- Format: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Location
    - Laravel: (Model or /config)
    - VUE: dedicated file @/constants/index.js / "const" object

## 5. Code Style
- Indentation (spaces or tabs): 
- Indentation size: 4 spaces for PHP (Laravel), 2 spaces for VUE and configuration files.
- Use of blank lines: 
    - One mandatory blank line between each method or function within a class.
    - End of file: One blank line

---

## 6. Comments and Documentation
- Brief comments only to understand complex code snippets
- Comment format
    - PHP and Typescript:
        /**
        * Calculates the total distance traveled by a vehicle.
        */
- Documentation in .md files in a separate repository.
